---"for loop" with two variables? [duplicate]
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18648626/for-loop-with-two-variables

If you want the effect of a nested for loop, use:

import itertools
for i, j in itertools.product(range(x), range(y)):
    # Stuff...
If you just want to loop simultaneously, use:

for i, j in zip(range(x), range(y)):
    # Stuff...
