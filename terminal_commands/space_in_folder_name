Your cd "~/Library/Application Support/" trial ends up quoting too much (the tilde and its slash), while your cd ~/Library/Application Support/ trial quotes too little (it omits quoting the space in the directory name).

The most common solution is to use single-character escaping to quote just the space:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support
