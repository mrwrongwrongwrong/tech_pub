What's the difference between %s and %d in Python string formatting?

name = 'marcog'
number = 42

print('%s %d' % (name, number))


%d is for decimal integer

%s is for generic string or object and in case of object, it will be converted to string

Consider the following code

name ='giacomo'
number = 4.3
print('%s %s %d %f %g' % (name, number, number, number, number))
the out put will be

giacomo 4.3 4 4.300000 4.3

as you can see %d will truncate to integer, %s will maintain formatting, %f will print as float and %g is used for generic number

obviously

print('%d' % (name))
will generate an exception; you cannot convert string to number
