readlines splits the entire file into lines and is equivalent to file.read().split('\n'), but is a bit more efficient. Your example,

for line in file:
    values = line.split()
splits each line by its spaces, building a list of words in the line. 
value is overwritten on each iteration so unless you save values somewhere, only parts of the file are in-memory at a single time.
