---strip(\n) and split()

They are 2 different python methods. Let me try to explain:

strip:

this method removes the character(s) passed by argument (or white spaces if no argument is passed) from the beginning and from the end of a string.

Examples:

In this example, strip would be the exact same “Hello World” since we called it without arguments, and there are no leading or trailing spaces:

>>>> example = "Hello World" 
>>>> example.strip() 
'Hello World' 
Here, it would remove leading and trailing ‘0’ characters, resulting in the same “Hello World”:

>>>> example = "000Hello World0" 
>>>> example.strip('0') 
'Hello World' 
split:

This method splits the input string into a list of strings. You can pass arguments too, known as delimiters. If you don’t pass any parameter, it will split using the default delimiter - space.

It is easier with some examples:

Passing no argument (using default delimiter):

>>>> example = "Hello World" 
>>>> example.split() 
['Hello', 'World'] 
Using the ‘x’ character delimiter:

>>>> example = "HelloxWorld Foo" 
>>>> example.split('x') 
['Hello', 'World Foo']
