  An empty csv file can be created like any other file - you just have to perform any operation on it. With bash, you can do touch /path/to/my/file.csv.

Note that you do not have to create an empty file for python to write in. 
Python will do so automatically if you write to a non-existing file. In fact, creating an empty file from within python means to open it for writing, but not writing anything to it.
