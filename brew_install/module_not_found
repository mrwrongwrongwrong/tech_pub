1.make sure you have installed the module.

2.If the module is installed, and there is still an error report on it, such as:
 No module named 'hps'
Then what I have to do is to set the export path manually:

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.0/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.0/sbin:$PATH"

or 
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages"

just put the corresponding module location between "" 
and run export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages" in terminal
