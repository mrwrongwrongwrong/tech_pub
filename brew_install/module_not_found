1.make sure you have installed the module.

2.If the module is installed, and there is still an error report on it, such as:
 No module named 'hps'
Then what I have to do is to set the export path manually:

(export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.0/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.0/sbin:$PATH"

or 
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages")

just put the corresponding module location between "" 
and run export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages" in terminal 


3. Compile the paths all together, to coherently make them work 
Then run: #https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22859/bash-ls-command-not-found
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin


#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15052206/python-pip-install-module-is-not-found-how-to-link-python-to-pip-location

In summary:
export PATH="/Users/zhousq/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages"
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
