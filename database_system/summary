1.ER:Entity,relationship,attribute
	Weak Entity, partial key
	Constraints in relationship: 1.cardinality ratio: 1:1, 1:N, N:1,M:N (between entity and entity)
				     2.participantion constraint: total or partial (whether being related or not)
	Attribute:
		key attribute, multivalued attribute, composite attribute, derived attribute

2.EER(all about superclass and subclass):
	EER model includes all the concepts from ER model, in addition:
	1. Subclasses and superclasses
	2. Specialization and generaliztion 
	3. Category or union type 
	4. Attribute and relationship inheritance 
	Hence, its all about the relation between superclass and subclass.

	

Superclass/subclass
	1. Superclass/subclass relationship: Employee/Secretary
	2. IS-A relationship: Secretary IS-A Employee (disjoint, overlapping, total, partial)
Ps. ISA can be:(the property of ISA)


Relationship
Chapter4:
EER = ER + 
	1. Subclass/superclass (type inheritance)
	2. Specialization/generalization
	3. Category/union
	4. Aggregation

---specialization
	1. Constraints 
		a. Predicate-defined (values on attribute)
		b. Defining predicate (condition)
		c. Attribute-defined(same attribute of the superclass)
		d. User-defined
		e. Disjointness constraint
		f. Completeness(totalness) constraint
